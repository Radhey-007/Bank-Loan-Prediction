# 🏡 Loan Eligibility Prediction 

## 📝 Introduction

In this project, we aim to predict whether customers are eligible for a loan and identify the missing criteria that might be preventing them from securing a loan to build their own house.

## 🚀 Steps Involved

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Gathering Data**: Collecting the necessary data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the data and its characteristics.
3. **Data Visualizations**: Creating visual representations of the data to better understand patterns and trends.
4. **Machine Learning Model Decision**: Choosing the appropriate machine learning model for the task.
5. **Training the ML Model**: Using the training set to train the chosen model.
6. **Predict Model**: Making predictions using the trained model.
7. **Deploy Model**: Deploying the model for real-time predictions.

## 🏠 House Loan

Imagine you are the owner of a Housing Finance Company and you want to build your own model to predict if the customers applying for a home loan are eligible. The company wants to automate the Loan Eligibility Process in real-time, based on the customer's details provided while filling out the application form for a home loan.

## ❓ Problem Statement

In simple terms, the company wants to automate the Loan Eligibility Process in real-time, based on the customer's details provided while filling out the application form for a home loan.

## 📊 Dataset

The training set will be used to build the model, and the test set will be used to validate it. Both files are stored on the web as CSV files.

## 📈 Results

The performance of various models on the dataset is as follows:

| Model | Score |
| --- | --- |
| Logistic Regression | 0.724324 |
| k-Nearest Neighbors | 0.632432 |
| XGBoost | 0.800000 |
| Random Forest | 0.821622 |

From the above table, we can see that the **Random Forest** model performed the best with a score of **0.821622**, followed by **XGBoost** with a score of **0.800000**. The **Logistic Regression** and **k-Nearest Neighbors** models had lower scores of **0.724324** and **0.632432** respectively.

These results can guide us in choosing the most effective model for predicting loan eligibility.
